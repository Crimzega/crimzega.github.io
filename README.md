# Crimzega's Temporary Website Location
The point of this github website is to test out online functionality.

## Reasons for existance
This is to do the following:
- Show off the [ILSpy Decompiler](https://crimzega.github.io/ilspy) with how close it is to the original code.
- Be a temprary housing for [my own songs](https://crimzega.github.io/music/library.html).
- Various file pathing for an official version of my website.
